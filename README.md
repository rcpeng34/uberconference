UberConference Code Challenge

The function stakeout takes an array and returns a number representing the greatest possible sum given the constraint that no two numbers that comprise the sum may be next to each other in the array (consecutive indices). If the input is not an array, the function will throw an error. 
If the array contains any non-numbers, the function will substitute 0 values for those elements.

The test file can be run by opening the spect html file. Alternatively, calling ./node_modules/.bin/mocha -w --reporter spec tests.js from the command line will also run the script in the terminal while watching files.
